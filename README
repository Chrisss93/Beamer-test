Hello!

This is my read me file for my basic novice guide to Beamer-Sweave-ggplot. In this repository should be located the .csv file of the data, publicly available from Statistics Canada CANSIM product, the .pdf, the .tex, and many auxiliary files from the compilation.

I am using a custom McGill .sty file that can be found here:
https://github.com/gsarkis/McGill-Beamer-Theme

Disclaimer: This is a novice guide because I myself am a novice at Beamer and Sweave. I'm not an expert, and this is not expert advice. But it may be helpful for beginners.

Thanks for reading!
